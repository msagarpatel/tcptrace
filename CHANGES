    packets

  added a lot more truncation checking!

3.2.4 - Tue Feb  4, 1997

  fixes from Bill Fenner, thanks
	fixed bug in va_start/va_end in DoPlot.

3.2.7 - Fri Feb 14, 1997
  fixes from Jeff Semke, PSC
    fixed bug in output.c that make it fail on some machines
    added FDDI support (untested by me, don't have FDDI)
    added Makefile flags so that it will compile on a "NetBSD 1.2 on a
	Pentium box"  (also untested by me, I don't have one)
  an HP compiler picked out some places where I missed a static
    decl for some functions.  Not fatal, but I fixed it.
3.2.8 - Tue Mar  4, 1997
  added changes for Mark
     allow connection reuse on same pair of IP addresses and ports
     4 minutes must have passed and either new segment has a SYN
     or old connection had seen both FINs
  added fix to tcptrace.c so that ^C processing is re-enabled after
     all packets read so that the output can be killed from the
     keyboard
  fix by Bill Fenner - Endian boo boo caused PC's not to read
     any packets.
  removed the "-m" option and made all of the array structures
     resizable (now supports an "infinite" number of connections)
  changed elapsed() routine to return double to prevent overflow
     of microsecond stored in a long int
3.2.9 - Wed Mar  5, 1997
  changes by Rich Jones at HP to run under HPUX
     mostly fixed the non-ansii standard

       to be
	#endif /* FOO */
  fixed minor printing bug, 1323 flags printed wrong
  fixed snoop and netm so that they worked on PC's
	(more byte sex problems)
