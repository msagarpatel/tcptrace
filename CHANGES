3.2.2 - Late 1996
  added better checking for looking too far into truncated
    packets

3.2.3 - Thu Jan 23, 1997
  added a lot more truncation checking!

3.2.4 - Tue Feb  4, 1997
  changed plotter.c:HostLetter(ix)
	to support unlimited (26**8) different endpoints (for mallman)
  fixes from Bill Fenner, thanks
	fixed bug in va_start/va_end in DoPlot.
	fixed bug with temporary colors not being done correctly
		when using text.  Caused by Changes to xplot at last
		version and I didn't catch it
3.2.5 - Wed Feb  5, 1997
  fixed small "off by one" error introduced by the LAST fix
3.2.6 - Thu Feb 13, 1997
  fixed small bug in etherpeek reading.  slicelength stored as "0" when
  entire packet was grabbed, didn't work before, now it does.
3.2.7 - Fri Feb 14, 1997
  fixes from Jeff Semke, PSC
    fixed bug in output.c that make it fail on some machines
    added FDDI support (untested by me, don't have FDDI)
    added Makefile flags so that it will compile on a "NetBSD 1.2 on a
	Pentium box"  (also untested by me, I don't have one)
  an HP compiler picked out some places where I missed a static
    decl for some functions.  Not fatal, but I fixed it.
3.2.8 - Tue Mar  4, 1997
  added changes for Mark
     allow connection reuse on same pair of IP addresses and ports
     4 minutes must have passed and either new segment has a SYN
     or old connection had seen both FINs
  added fix to tcptrace.c so that ^C processing is re-enabled after
     all packets read so that the output can be killed from the
     keyboard
  fix by Bill Fenner - Endian boo boo caused PC's not to read
     any packets.
  removed the "-m" option and made all of the array structures
     resizable (now supports an "infinite" number of connections)
  changed elapsed() routine to return double to prevent overflow
     of microsecond stored in a long int
3.2.9 - Wed Mar  5, 1997
  changes by Rich Jones at HP to run under HPUX
     mostly fixed the non-ansii standard
	#endif FOO
       to be
	#endif /* FOO */
  fixed minor printing bug, 1323 flags printed wrong
  fixed snoop and netm so that they worked on PC's
	(more byte sex problems)
3.2.10 - Thu Mar 27, 1997
  Mark "pushed" segments on TSG plots
    top arrow is red instead of white
  Compute slow-start window size (should be one except for "new" tcp's)
  Compute estimated congestion window
3.2.11a - Mon Mar 31, 1997
  Fixed bug is TS options are not 4-byte aligned
  Fixed tick printing (bad % value) for HUGE files (millions of packets)
     
3.2.12a - Thu Apr 24, 1997
  Fixed bug for file with large snap length
     
3.2.13a - Mon Apr 28, 1997
  Big fix for Rob Austein <sra@epilogue.com>
  otherdir->ack being initialized incorrectly in trace.c at SYN time
     
3.3.0 - Mon Jul 14, 1997
  Added modules support
    Included http module for NASA
  Backed out delete of libpcap, causes too many problems
  Now using libpcap 0.4

4.0.1 - Tue Jul 15, 1997
  Ready for next public release (I hope)
  Verified on the platforms I have access to

4.0.2 - Wed Jul 16, 1997
  Added '-W' option to turn off Mark's estimated Cwin stuff, it's not
    generally useful
  Added raw packet printing to mod_http

4.0.3 - Thu Jul 24, 1997
  Fixed tcpdump.c to work with lastest libpcap
   (can no longer assume that header is aligned :-(  )
  Added plast into all packet reading routines to better check for the end
   of packets
  Added fix from Kacheong Poon for sack truncation problem

4.0.4 - Wed Aug 13, 1997
  Added some very minor patches to ease FreeBSD patch.  All you should need to do
    now is change the Makefile for FreeBSD (thanks Bill Fenner)
  Added hack by Mark Allman for http module
  Added minor changes to support Linux compilation (mostly just left
    the standard include files in a separate linux directory)
4.1.0 - Fri Aug 22, 1997
  Added support for reading compressed files (configurable, .gz and .Z by default)
  Added option to save TCP stream data into files (-e)
  Modified mod_http.c to support HTTP1.1 streams (ick)
  Added help argument "-h" with several options for information
    including docs for long format output
4.1.1 - Fri Sep  5, 1997
  Minor mfiles bug fixes
  mod_http now generates plot files, still experimenting
  fixed tcpdump to allow files with DLT_NULL headers
4.1.2
  Added more module interface routines
  Allow modules to have per-connection data structures
  Fixed some compression bugs
4.1.3
  Added "percent done" for compressed files, just a guess but better than N/A
  Passed filesize and compressed state to modules
  Added mod_traffic
  fixed bug in extract_contents (for mod_http) that caused it to fail if the first segment
    seen was not the first segment of the connection (oops!)
  Added -z flag to plot time axis from 0 rather than wallclock time
  big lint cleanup
  added support for "configure" to simplify cross-platform stuff
  added Mark's "data xmit time" code
4.1.4
  minor LINT fix in print.c
  added  ECHO/ECHOREPL CC/CCNEW/CCECHO to understood options
  added support for Etherpeek version 7 save file format
  fixed minor http modules bugs
  changed some longer fields to use "long long" if available
  added "pushed packets" counter
  added hardware duplicate detection
5.0a
  adding Nasseef's IPv6 support
  added the -y flag to turn off the (yellow) instantaneous dots in the tput plot
  first cut at the output filtering code (slick!)
5.0.2
  added support for DLT_RAW under tcpdump (pcap)
5.0.3
  bug fix for John Tysko, tcp_length & tcp_data_length were unsigned
    and resulting in a HUGE amount of data if the tcp header was
    truncated.  Changed to unsigned.
  count/print truncated bytes/segs ALWAYS, not just when extracting data
  changed to use flex/bison for better portability
  fixed bug in etherpeek for odd-sized packets from compressed files
5.0.4 - Thu May 14, 1998
  forced the "char" types for tcp_opt for ws and sack_count to be
    "SIGNED char", because the compiler on my PB3400/Linux makes them
     unsigned by default.  The "-fsigned-char" could also fix it, but this
     seems easier.
5.0.5 - Tue Jun 23, 1998 -- Fri Aug  7, 1998
  fixed mod_traffic memory allocation bug.  I wonder why nobody reported this? 
  added "pure ack" counter (for Mark)
  added call to print modules usage for "-hargs"
  added Eric's tcplib-generating module
  added check for ASCII input
  added reading of arguments from resource file, then from envariable, and
    then from the command line (suggestion from Jeff Semke)
  can read from standard input if filename is "stdin"
  extended "-z" option to allow you to lock either the X or the Y axis
     (or both) to zero (for Brian Utterback)
  added printing of zero-sized packets (for Brian Utterback)
  zero-sized packets pointed out a "bug" in the zero-based time stuff from
    version 4.1.3.  Both graphs in a pair don't have the same "zero point",
    which is a little confusing.  They were off by 1/2 a RTT, the
    difference between the SYN and the SYN/ACK.  I fixed this by adding a
    green dot corresponding the the first SYN in the second graph.  Kind
    of helpful in general, too.
  added Mallman's netbsd mkstemp change in compress.c
  extended the "-w" flag to make the normal case quieter
  lots of changes to mod_traffic, plus a few bugfixes, mostly for my use
5.0.6 - Fri Aug 14, 1998
  added UDP connection support, a lot of people have been asking for it
  finished mod_collie
5.0.7 - Mon Aug 24, 1998
  fixed bug in StringToArgv() that messed up when the arg buffer started
    with whitespace
5.0.8 - Wed Sep  9, 1998
  changed mod_traffic to ALWAYS 'quiet' the final traffic output
  fixed bug report from Mark, SYN RTT's weren't being included in min
	RTT report.  Fixed so that both SYNs and FINs are included in that
	calculation.
5.0.9 - Thu Sep 24, 1998
  fixed bug with "only" connections not detecting reuse of ports
  added warnings for re-ordered packets and/or files
5.0.10 - Thu Oct  1, 1998
  bug fix in snoop.c, netm.c, and epeek.c
    Just a check for bogus save files with invalid packet lengths to
    keep the program from crashing without warning
  fixed args in tcplib module to match the conventions in the other modules
  added "long duration" connection graph to traffic module
  bug fixes from Michele Clark - UNC
    thruput plot files - graph for both directions had the same title
    suggested making the type for the xplot sequence number axis "double"
	rather than "unsigned".  The unsigned was from Tim Shepard's
	original xplot demo files.  She says that double makes it work
	better for large sequence numbers.  I'll try it and see if anybody
	has trouble.
  changed "new connection" heuristic.  Then a new connection uses the same
    pair of ports as a previous connection, it wasn't always being detected.
    This was originally pointed out by Brian Utterback and later by Mark
    Allman.  New heuristic is more in line with RFC1122 (SYN is out of
     the sequence space for the previous connection).
5.0.11 - Mon Oct 19, 1998
  Brian Utterback found another case where I was splicing connections
    together.  Bad unsigned match caused it...  fixed (knock, knock)
5.0.12 - Mon Nov  2, 1998
  Added generic, high-level line drawing functions to plotter.c
  Used same in mod_traffic to add an overall RTT plot
  Added one more minor patch to the connection splicing heuristic
  Lots of changes to make the RTT calculation better in cases of
    retransmissions and etc
  Added RTT graph to the traffic module
  Added triple-dupack counter
  Added triple dupack tick on TSG graphs
  Added dongles to ACKS on the TSG graphs to distinguish different kinds of
    ACKS that need to be handled differently for RTT calculation
