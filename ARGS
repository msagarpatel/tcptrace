In Use Options

-AN     Average N segments for throughput graphs, default is 10
-BN     first segment number to analyze (default 1)
-C      produce color plot[s]
-D      print in decimal
-EN     last segment number to analyze (default last in file)
-G	  create ALL 3 graphs
-M      produce monochrome (b/w) plot[s]
-O file output packets to tcpdump file
-R      create rtt sample graph[s]
-S      create time sequence graph[s]
-T      create throughput graph[s], (average over 10 segments, see -A)
-W      report on estimated congestion window (not generally useful)
-X      print in hexidecimal
-Z      dump raw rtt sample times to file[s]

-b      brief output format
-c      ignore non-complete connections (didn't see syn's and fin's)
-d      whistle while you work (enable debug, use -d -d for more output)
-e      extract contents of each TCP stream into file
-f 	EXPR output filtering (see -hfilter)
-h      print help messages
-iN     ignore connection N (can use multiple times)
-l      long output format
-m	 obsolete
-n      don't resolve host or service names (much faster)
-oN     only connection N (can use multiple times)
-p      print individual packet contents (can be very long)
-q      no output (if you just want modules output)
-r      print rtt statistics (slower for large files)
-s      use short names (list \"picard.cs.ohiou.edu\" as just \"picard\")
-t      'tick' off the packet numbers as a progress indication
-u      minimal UDP stats too
-v      print version information and exit
-w      print warning message when packets are too short to process
-xMODULE_SPECIFIC
-y      omit the (yellow) instantaneous throughput points in tput graph
-zAXIS  plot time axis and sequence number from 0
