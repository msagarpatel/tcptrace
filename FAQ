Probably.  It appears that you're doing the "packet grabbing" on the
same machine that's hosting the connection.  That's a problem under
SunOS (and maybe other systems).  Their packet capturing pseudo-device
can't grab both ends of a connection whose home is the local machine.
I never can remember which end it omits, but given your output, it
appears that it can't see packets SENT by the local host.  The easiest
solution is to run tcpdump on a machine OTHER than the ones you're
monitoring.

The "diamond" means that the segment was sent with a PUSH (so most
segments will have these except for large data transfers).  This feature
is now documented in the on-line docs.

Yes, this is a problem.  The only way to do it is to add invisible
points outside the normal range, xplot won't let me control the area
otherwise.  In this particular case, however, there's an easy
solution: use the middle mouse button to move the graph so that the
lower corner all shows.  Using this, you can scroll anywhere on the
screen, even outside the boundaries of the points being plotted.

I'm sorry, I don't keep up on Microsoft software.  Lots of people have
asked me this question and I don't know the answer.  I'm pretty sure
that tcpdump does NOT run under NT.  The only packet-grabbing software 
that I'm aware of for Wintel machines is etherpeek (Windows/NT/Mac):

	http://www.aggroup.com/

It's nice software, but it's commercial.

:-)

Yes, that's why it's called _TCP_trace!!!  Seriously, I've never had
any reason to look at UDP packets.  Tcptrace was designed to explore
TCP's protocol details and there's not much protocol detail to UDP to
look into.

(update, version 5 DOES support UDP a little, but you need to add the
"-u" option, as it ignores UDP by default)

If you want really good data from tcpdump, you need to run it on a
machine on the same LAN as the tcp sender, but NOT on the same
machine.  You also need to make sure that the data that you're writing
is going to a local file system, rather than a remote file system,
which would cause extra network traffic.

From what you describe, I'm assuming that you're running tcpdump on
the SAME machine as one connection endpoint.  I've never seen a case
in which running tcpdump on a reasonably fast machine would slow it
down enough to cause that sort of degradation.  One other possibility
is that the machine is busy enough that tcpdump is not seeing all the
packets (which IS common, the kernel drops them if tcpdump gets
behind).  Tcptrace only counts the packets that it sees, so if it only
sees half of them, its throughput estimate will be off by half.

The other possibility that I alluded to is that you're writing the
packet data to a file system on a different machine.  That competing
network traffic might congest the network enough to skew the results.


>> And a last question: In case of TPUT which line should I consider?
>> I suspect it should be the blue one.

That's the running average.  Network throughput is difficult to
represent discretely.  Normally, you take bytes/second over a short
period of time.  The blue line is a running average of that figure
from the beginning of the connection.  If you want a numeric answer,
just use "-l" with tcptrace and look at the figure that it prints
out.

Just a note about these files.  The magic first line that gets created on
them is nonstandard.  The first line of a postscript file is supposed to
look like:

#!PS (and possibly more stuff)

but xplot generates

#!POSTSCRIPT

That's not correct, but some older printers don't mind.  My experience
with newer printers is that they WON'T recognize it and will misbehave
in annoying ways.  If you change the first like to #!PS it'll work
fine.  If you have the xplot source, you might as well fix this and
recompile (that's what I always do).

>> I just installed tcptrace and xplot, but I'm having trouble 
>> figuring out how to load the neat plots into xplot?
>> Any chance of including a typical session in the docs?

There's not much to it.  Tcptrace creates plot files with the suffix
".xpl".  To see a single plot:

    xplot a2b_tsg.xpl

a VERY nice feature for lining up plots is the "-x" which locks all
graphs to the same X axis.  For example, you can:

    xplot -x a2b_tsg.xpl  b2a_tsg.xpl

and it'll show you BOTH plots.  When you zoom in on one, the other
zooms in too.  Very handy, particularly if you line them up across you 
screen like:

  +----------------------------------------+
  |                                        | screen

>> xplot doesn't work

if you type

   xplot [FILE].xpl

and see some sort of strange syntax error warnings, type

   xplot -v

   output:
	   xplot version 0.90

if you see something that doesn't look much like that, make sure that
you're running the correct "xplot" program.  There are probably a lot of
programs around with the same name.  You want the one from:

It's just from the port numbers.  RFC 1700 

	http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1700.html

gives the official purposes of all of the low-numbered ports.  Unix
machines usually have a subset of this document in /etc/services,
which is where snoop et. al. get their application information.  If
you have a lot of traffic on official ports that AREN'T in this file,
If you can add more entries and make the snoop (and tcptrace)
information easier to read.
