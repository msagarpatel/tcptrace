tcptrace is a TCP connection analysis tool.  It can tell you detailed
information about TCP connections by sifting through dump files.  The
dump file formats supported are:
   Sun's snoop format
   Standard tcpdump format (you need pcap library)
   Macintosh Etherpeek format
   HP/NetMetrix protocol analysis format

To see the graphs, you'll also need Tim Shepard's xplot program,
available on mercury.lcs.mit.edu:
	ftp://mercury.lcs.mit.edu/pub/shep 

As this is the first public release of tcptrace, the installation
procedure is fairly raw.  There's a standard Makefile here.  The
program has been successfully compiled on various Sun platforms here
using GCC.  I'd love to hear from people who have problems (preferably
with solutions!!!).

Most of the rest of the Docs are on the web.  Check out:

Running the program
-------------------

Some simple examples:

0) What are the args and what do they mean???
     tcptrace 

1) Run the program quickly over a dump file
     tcptrace dumpfile

2) Get longer output
     tcptrace -l dumpfile

3) Generate lots of pretty plot files (you need xplot to see them)
     tcptrace -G dumpfile

4) Print the segment contents as you go
     tcptrace -p dumpfile

5) Print progress info (useful for large files)
     tcptrace -t dumpfile

Of course, you can chain arguments together until you get just what
you want.  


Let me know what you think....
