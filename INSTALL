OK, to the best of my knowledge, you should be able to get tcptrace to
compile and run under:

Solaris
NetBSD
FreeBSD
Linux
HPux

Step 1: Get pcap library
  If you want to be able to read tcpdump format files, then you'll
  need to have already installed the pcap library (see README.pcap).
  If tcpdump was installed correctly, then you're probably all set.
  If you don't HAVE this package and don't CARE about it, then comment
  "GROK_TCPDUMP" out of "config.h" and we'll just skip it in the
  compilation. 

Step 2: Edit Makefile
  Make some simple changes to the Makefile (look for comments for
  your target) and then just typing "make".

Step 3: Install
  The program doesn't need to be setuid or anything, so once you get
  the "tcptrace" binary, just stuff it wherever you keep such things
  and you're all set.
